"Hdfs HA formatting

In HA things get a little more complicated. In HA Standby and Active namenodes have a shared storage managed by the journal node service. HA relies on a failover scenario to swap from StandBy to Active Namenode and as any other system in hadoop this uses zookeeper. As you can see a couple more pieces need to made aware of a formatting action.

The initial steps are very close

Stop the Hdfs service Start only the journal nodes (as they will need to be made aware of the formatting) On the first namenode (as user hdfs) hadoop namenode -format​ hdfs namenode -initializeSharedEdits -force (for the journal nodes) hdfs zkfc -formatZK -force (to force zookeeper to reinitialise)​ restart that first namenode On the second namenode hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby -force ​(force synch with first namenode) On every datanode clear the data directory Restart the HDFS service This was a very simple step by step guide to formatting. In a later article we will cover actually repairing common errors in HDFS"

Start All HDFS Services. start data nodes

Then start resource manager and node manager respectively
